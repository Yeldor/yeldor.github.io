                    Borderlands is a great game. It ties in a good story, awesome gameplay, and most importantly,
                    AMAZING LOOT!
                    If
                    your as serious as us, you're aware of the “Golden Key” system that’s in the game. PiTCH KEYS is
                    here
                    to make it a whole lot easier for everyone to get the most out of their Borderlands experience!

                    <h2>What are Golden Keys?</h2>
                    Golden Keys are keys within the game that let you unlock a specific chest in Sanctuary. The cost to
                    unlock
                    this
                    chest is one golden key.

                    <h2>How do I Unlock Golden Keys?</h2>
                    For most cases, golden keys are unlocked by entering codes called SHiFT keys through the Gearbox
                    website.

                    <h2>Where can I get a SHiFT key?</h2>
                    Usually, SHiFT keys are posted by (who he is), Randy Pitchford on Twitter. These keys are posted
                    randomly
                    at a
                    time with varying amounts of keys. However, with SHiFT Scan, we take the leverage of constantly
                    watching
                    for
                    updates on Randy’s twitter, the time process of entering several codes at a time, and the annoyance
                    of
                    reentering a key that you already entered!
