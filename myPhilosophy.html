       In my young years of coding, I have a definition to what makes a good programmer. In my eyes, a good programmer isn't 
       decided by what they know. However, A good programmer is decided by how they THINK. Think of all the tools we have as 
       programmers, where now, in what i'd like to call a programming rennisance, theres practically a library for EVERYTHING 
       we can think of! as great as these tools are, it takes a person with great imagination to really think of how everything 
       will come together in the most elegant and efficient fashion.
